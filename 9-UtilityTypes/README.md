## LESSON 9: Utility Type

### 1. Partial
partial can include one to all props inside a type alias or interface


### 2. Required and Readonly


### 3. Record<K, T>: Construct a type that with a set of properties (k) with T as its value type

### 4. Pick and Omit: applying to the object interface we have generated, pick or omit some of props, they are the new type that is under the subset of props inside the interface

### 5. Exclude and Extract: applying for string literal union types

### 6. Nonnullable: apply to the string literal union, only accept those nonnull and defined string literal types

### 8. ReturnType: used for creating a new type = function returned type (based on the output of a function type)

### 9. Parameters: derive the parameters in the  function type in tuple (based on the inputs of  a function type)

### 10. Awaited - helps us with the ReturnType of a Promise
